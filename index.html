            <h2>What Is "Help Self-Healing"?</h2>
            <p>
                
                When God created all living things, He gave each one an inner strength, a natural ability to heal itself. In the past, people lived closer to nature. 
                But today, our world is filled with pollution—air, noise, water—and much of what we consume is 
                altered by human hands. As a result, many people rely heavily on medicine, which weakens the body's natural defenses. While modern treatments may 
                bring quick relief, they often come with hidden long-term consequences.
                <br>
                <br>
                At VNHands, we follow traditional healing methods passed down by our ancestors to support the body's natural recovery from within. "Help Self-Healing"
                is not just about physical wellness—it's about restoring your inner strength and embracing a more vibrant life. As the saying goes, “What is different 
                is beautiful”—a truth that will always remain.

            <P>My name is Thi Kim Ngan Tran. I have over 8 years of experience in
                therapeutic massage including such as deep tissue,relaxation,
                reflexology and Eastern methods. Before moving to the UK, I worked as a
                massage therapist in Viet Nam, where I built strong and trusted
                relationships with my clients. They appreciated my care,skill and
                personalised treatment.<br>
                <br>
                Now I'm living in Swansea, I want to bring the same high-quality,healing
                service to my local community. I believe massage is not only for
                relaxation but also for improving health and well-being.
               <br>
                <br>
                In addition to formal qualifications and continuous professtional
                development, I'm currently volunteering as a massage therapist at
                Swansea Care Centre. This experience allows me to support the people in the
                community while further developing my skill and demonstrating a strong
                commitment to care and service.<br>
                <br>
